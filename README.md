📘 CBS5055: Generative Artificial Intelligence for Innovative Communications

This repository supports CBS5055 – Generative Artificial Intelligence for Innovative Communications (HHBUG06), a postgraduate-level course that explores how generative AI technologies—particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multimodal models—are applied in contemporary communication practices.
The course combines theoretical foundations, ethical considerations, and hands-on workshops, enabling students to work with real-world data and AI tools for social media analysis, branding, advertising, public relations, and campaign design.
